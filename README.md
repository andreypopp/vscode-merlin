# VS Code Merlin Extension

ðŸš§ This is work in progress, use at your own risk ðŸš§

## Prerequisites

This extension requires global installation of `esy >= 0.6.0` to allow building of [`ocaml-lsp-server`](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp#esy) for your projects.
```
npm i -g @esy-nightly/esy
or
yarn global add @esy-nightly/esy
```

## Producing the Extension Package

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:arrowresearch/vscode-merlin.git

# Install dependencies
cd vscode-merlin
npm i

# Build from reason
npm run build

# Produce package
npm run package

# Install produced package
code --install-extension vscode-merlin-[VERSION].vsix
```

## Usage

### Bucklescript
Open any of your projects (esy/bsb/opam are supported) and any of the Reason/Ocaml file in it. Extension will start initialization, vscode will display progressbar (usually in the bottom left corner). After initialization is finished, extension should fully work.

Be mindful, that first initialization can take significant amount of time, as extension will download and compile right version of `ocaml`, `ocaml-lsp` and other dependencies. Future inits in similar project (with the same version of compiler) will be almost instant.

If extension fails to initialize for some reason, please [file an issue](https://github.com/arrowresearch/vscode-merlin/issues)

### Esy
Update your `esy.json` to include:
```js
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@esy-ocaml/reason": "*",
    "@opam/ocaml-lsp-server": "ocaml/ocaml-lsp:ocaml-lsp-server.opam#e5e6ebf9dcf157",
    "@opam/ocamlformat": "*",
  }
},
```

### Opam
```bash
# Pin and install ocaml-lsp-server
opam pin add ocaml-lsp-server https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp.git

# Install other dependencies if needed
opam install ocamlformat reason
```
